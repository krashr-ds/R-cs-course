CS and R Course for Analysts

This is a series of PowerPoint presentations and R Studio Notebooks in progress.  

I am creating these to help my fellow analysts at Washington State University's 
Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine learn R, beginning with computer and CS fundamentals, 
and then moving on to R-specific language features, data wrangling and statistics and modeling.
