CS and R Course for Analysts

This is a series of PowerPoint presentations and R Studio Notebooks originally created 
to help my fellow analysts at Washington State University's Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine 
learn R, beginning with computer and CS fundamentals, and then moving on to R-specific language 
features, data wrangling and some statistics and modeling.
